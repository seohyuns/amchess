<h2>Contact A &amp; M Chess Camps</h2>

<p> Despite the guilt trip we 
  tried to lay on you in our <%= link_to "about page", about_path %>, the 
  fact is that these camps are a fiction created for a class project for students at Carnegie Mellon University. No doubt you wanted to sign your 
  child up for every camp we offer so they wouldn't lose every round at 
  chess tournaments, but apparently you'll just have to keep getting used to losing.  
  If you are bitterly disappointed (and quite honestly, you should be) and want to grouse to someone, here's the contact info:</p>
